# 🔒 Security Guide for MAIAChat Desktop

**Created by Aleksander Celewicz**

This document outlines security best practices, privacy considerations, and data protection measures for MAIAChat Desktop.

## 🛡️ Security Overview

MAIAChat Desktop is designed with security and privacy as core principles:

- **🏠 Local Processing**: All conversations and data remain on your machine
- **🔐 Secure API Management**: Encrypted storage of API keys with no external transmission
- **🚫 No Telemetry**: Zero data collection, tracking, or analytics
- **🔓 Open Source**: Full transparency with auditable code
- **🔒 Isolated Environment**: No unnecessary network access or system permissions

## 🔑 API Key Security

### Best Practices

1. **Never Share API Keys**
   ```bash
   # ❌ DON'T: Commit API keys to version control
   git add config.json  # This file contains your API keys!
   
   # ✅ DO: Use the example file and keep config.json private
   cp config.json.example config.json
   # Edit config.json with your keys (already in .gitignore)
   ```

2. **Use Environment Variables** (Optional)
   ```bash
   # More secure: Set as environment variables
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-your-key-here"
   ```

3. **Regular Key Rotation**
   - Rotate API keys every 90 days
   - Immediately rotate if you suspect compromise
   - Use provider dashboards to monitor usage

4. **Principle of Least Privilege**
   - Only add API keys for providers you actually use
   - Use read-only keys when available
   - Monitor API usage for unusual activity

### Secure Storage

MAIAChat uses multiple layers of protection for API keys:

```
🔒 Local Storage Only
├── config.json (excluded from git via .gitignore)
├── Encrypted in memory during runtime
├── No transmission to external servers
└── Cleared from memory on application exit
```

### API Key Validation

The application validates API keys before use:
- Format validation (correct prefix and length)
- Test calls to verify functionality
- Graceful error handling for invalid keys
- No key logging in error messages

## 🏠 Data Privacy

### What Stays Local

✅ **Always Local**:
- All conversation history
- Knowledge base documents and embeddings
- User preferences and settings
- Agent configurations and profiles
- Cache files and temporary data

❌ **Never Transmitted**:
- Your API keys (only used for direct provider calls)
- Conversation content (except to chosen AI providers)
- Personal documents in knowledge base
- Usage patterns or analytics

### AI Provider Communication

When you use MAIAChat, here's what happens:

```
Your Computer → AI Provider (OpenAI/Anthropic/etc.)
├── ✅ Your message content (necessary for AI response)
├── ✅ System prompts and agent instructions
├── ❌ Your API keys (used for authentication only)
├── ❌ Other conversations or personal data
└── ❌ Any MAIAChat usage analytics
```

### Knowledge Base Security

Your uploaded documents are processed locally:

1. **Local Processing**: Documents never leave your machine
2. **FAISS Indexing**: Vector embeddings stored locally
3. **Encrypted Storage**: Knowledge base files protected
4. **Access Control**: Only MAIAChat can access the knowledge base

## 🌐 Network Security

### Minimal Network Access

MAIAChat only makes network requests to:
- **AI Provider APIs**: For generating responses
- **Search APIs**: When using internet search features (optional)
- **Model Downloads**: For local models (Ollama, embeddings)

### No External Dependencies

- No analytics or tracking services
- No automatic updates or telemetry
- No external configuration fetching
- No usage reporting or crash dumps

### Firewall Configuration

For maximum security, you can restrict MAIAChat's network access:

```bash
# Allow only necessary AI provider domains
# OpenAI: api.openai.com
# Anthropic: api.anthropic.com
# Google: generativelanguage.googleapis.com
# Block all other domains for MAIAChat process
```

## 🔐 System Security

### File Permissions

MAIAChat requires minimal system permissions:

```
📁 Application Directory: Read/Write (for logs and cache)
📁 Knowledge Base: Read/Write (for document storage)
📁 Configuration: Read/Write (for settings)
🚫 System Files: No access required
🚫 Other User Data: No access required
🚫 Network Admin: No elevated privileges needed
```

### Sandboxing Recommendations

For enhanced security, consider running MAIAChat in a sandbox:

```bash
# Example: Using firejail on Linux
firejail --net=none --private-tmp python start_app.py

# Example: Using Windows Sandbox
# Run MAIAChat inside Windows Sandbox for isolation
```

### Antivirus Considerations

MAIAChat is safe for antivirus software:
- No code injection or system modification
- No suspicious network behavior
- All files are legitimate Python scripts
- Open source code available for inspection

## 🚨 Incident Response

### If You Suspect Compromise

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   ```bash
   # Stop the application
   # Rotate all API keys immediately
   # Check provider usage logs for unusual activity
   ```

2. **Investigation**:
   - Review log files for suspicious activity
   - Check network connections during runtime
   - Verify file integrity of MAIAChat installation

3. **Recovery**:
   - Download fresh copy of MAIAChat
   - Generate new API keys
   - Clear and rebuild knowledge base if needed

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **Contact** Aleksander Celewicz directly
3. **Include** detailed reproduction steps
4. **Provide** your system information and MAIAChat version

We take security seriously and will respond promptly to legitimate security reports.

## ✅ Security Checklist

Before using MAIAChat in production:

- [ ] API keys stored securely (not in version control)
- [ ] Regular key rotation schedule established
- [ ] Network access restricted if needed
- [ ] Antivirus whitelist configured
- [ ] Backup strategy for conversations and knowledge base
- [ ] Understanding of data flow and privacy implications
- [ ] Incident response plan in place

## 🔍 Security Auditing

### Self-Audit Steps

1. **Check File Permissions**:
   ```bash
   # Verify only necessary files are accessible
   ls -la config.json knowledge_base/ conversation_history/
   ```

2. **Monitor Network Traffic**:
   ```bash
   # Use tools like Wireshark or netstat to verify connections
   netstat -an | grep python
   ```

3. **Review Log Files**:
   ```bash
   # Check for any suspicious activity
   tail -f start_app.log rag_handler.log
   ```

### Professional Security Review

For enterprise use, consider:
- Third-party security audit
- Penetration testing
- Code review by security professionals
- Compliance assessment (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
