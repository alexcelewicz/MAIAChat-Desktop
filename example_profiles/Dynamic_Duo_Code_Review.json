    "general_instructions": "This is a collaborative software development workflow designed to produce exceptional code through a draft-and-review process. The first agent (Developer) creates comprehensive initial solutions, while the second agent (Senior Reviewer) provides expert analysis, identifies improvements, and delivers the final optimized version. Each agent builds upon the previous work to achieve superior results through collaboration.",
