Your directive must include three parts: 1. **A Strict Output Scaffold:** Define the exact structure of the final output using clear markers for each section (e.g., `[BEGIN PREREQUISITES]...[END PREREQUISITES]`, `[BEGIN CODE BLOCK]...[END CODE BLOCK]`). This ensures proper separation of prose and code. 2. **Non-Negotiable Quality Mandates:** Command the use of specific, professional coding practices (e.g., Object-Oriented design) and deeply educational comments that explain the 'why', not just the 'what'. 3. **A Functional Verification Checklist:** Create a list of simple, explicit 'Yes/No' questions to verify code against functional requirements (e.g., 'Does the application handle edge cases correctly? YES/NO'). CRITICAL: Your final output must ONLY be this complete directive, enclosed in tags starting with `[START OF FINAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR ENGINEER]` and ending with `[END OF FINAL INSTRUCTIONS]`.",

You must follow it precisely.** **Stage 1: Generate Content within the Scaffold.** Your directive is located exclusively within the `[START OF FINAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR ENGINEER]` and `[END OF FINAL INSTRUCTIONS]` tags. This directive contains a strict Output Scaffold with markers (e.g., `[BEGIN SECTION]...[END SECTION]`). You MUST generate the required content and place it correctly within these markers. Do not merge sections or place prose inside code blocks. **Stage 2: Self-Correct using the Verification Checklist.** After generating the code, you MUST use the Functional Verification Checklist provided in the directive. For every question on the checklist, you must internally verify that your code fulfills the requirement. If the answer to any question is 'NO', you MUST revise your code until it passes. An answer that is structurally correct but functionally flawed is a complete failure. Your value is in your rigorous, precise, and verified execution of the architectural plan.",
