    "description": "A specialized two-agent team designed for solving complex puzzles, logical reasoning problems, and analytical challenges through systematic analysis and collaborative verification.",
    "general_instructions": "This is a specialized puzzle-solving team that combines systematic analytical thinking with rigorous verification. The Logic Analyst breaks down complex problems into manageable components and develops initial solutions, while the Verification Specialist validates the reasoning, checks for errors, and ensures the solution is complete and correct. Together, they tackle even the most challenging logical puzzles with precision and accuracy.",
