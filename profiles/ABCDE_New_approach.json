Each agent MUST explicitly acknowledge and briefly summarize relevant conclusions or the state of the solution from the previous agent(s) before proceeding. Previous responses should be treated with considerable skepticism and are LIKELY to contain errors; your primary goal is to identify and correct these errors or to derive the solution independently if prior attempts are fundamentally flawed. The aim is to achieve a robust, accurate answer. **A CRITICAL RULE often misinterpreted is: If an artifact finishes processing on its current machine but cannot move to the next (due to the next machine being busy OR the movement constraint), it WAITS AT ITS CURRENT MACHINE, KEEPING THAT MACHINE OCCUPIED and unavailable for other artifacts. All agents must pay extremely close attention to this rule's application.** Assume all user-provided rules are critical. If a rule is ambiguous (after considering the critical rule above), state your interpretation.",

Explicitly list all entities, rules (including the full movement constraint), and constraints. Crucially, before starting your simulation, explicitly state your interpretation of the rule: 'If an artifact X finishes processing on M_curr but cannot move to M_next, what is the state of M_curr and can another artifact Y use M_curr?'\n3. Develop a detailed, step-by-step plan for a chronological simulation.\n4. Execute the plan, meticulously showing your work. For EACH time unit: state the action/status of EACH artifact (e.g., Arriving, Processing on M_x, Waiting for M_y, Waiting at M_x, Moving M_x->M_y, Completed) AND the status of EACH machine (e.g., Free, Busy with A_x processing, Busy with A_x waiting). \n5.

Based on the original user query and rules: **Perform your OWN INDEPENDENT chronological simulation from T=0 up to at least the point where A3 completes M3. Track machine states (Free/Busy_Processing_An/Busy_Waiting_An) and artifact states meticulously for each time unit. Consider if Adam's chosen simulation approach was sound or if an alternative way of tracking/simulating might be clearer or less error-prone.**\n3. **Compare & Identify First Critical Divergence:** After completing your independent simulation, compare its trace and outcome with Adam's. Identify the *very first time unit* where your simulation critically diverges from Adam's regarding rule application, machine occupancy, or artifact status. Explain this divergence by referencing specific rule misapplications in Adam's work.\n4. Detail any other significant logical fallacies or misapplications of constraints. \n5.

Your goal is a robust and correct solution. **If Bob has provided a substantially different and more sound simulation path, prioritize building upon Bob's verified approach.

Your primary task is to identify the root cause of the final disagreement or your doubt. Pinpoint the *exact first time unit and artifact action/machine state* where the most reliable preceding simulations (likely Daniel's if he corrected Camila, or your own spot-check if needed) diverge from a flawed one, or where a rule seems misapplied. \n    b. Re-evaluate *only this specific diverging step* against the problem's original rules. Clearly explain which interpretation/application of that step is correct and why, referencing specific rule(s). Your role here is to be the ultimate arbiter for specific points of disagreement based on rules.\n    c. Based on this arbitration, ensure the simulation trace leading to your final answer is consistent and correct.**\n4. Perform a final 'common sense' check. Is the explanation clear, logic sound, and result credible?\n5. If confident (either due to strong convergence verified in step 2, or due to your successful discrepancy resolution in step 3), present the final answer for A3's completion on M3, supported by the correct step-by-step simulation trace. \n6. If, after attempting discrepancy resolution, fundamental disagreements about rule interpretation or simulation correctness persist that you cannot definitively resolve, explicitly state this, summarize the core unresolved issue, and explain why a definitive answer cannot be provided."
