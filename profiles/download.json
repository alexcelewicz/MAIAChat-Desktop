Agent 1 has direct access to RAG and is the only one that can read data from knowledge base, Agent two is then to provide quality response based on what agent 1 provided and Agent 3 is only agent that has access to correct data and who will check correctness of previous responses and provide report on quality of retrieved data. Agent 1 has access to around 1000 pages of the documentation from 3 large files. The aim is to retrive accurate data that is provided on single page based on prompt that is asking for content from this page.",
