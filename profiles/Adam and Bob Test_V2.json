Your directive for Bob must include three parts: 1. **A Strict Output Scaffold:** Define the exact structure of Bob's final output using clear markers for each section (e.g., `[BEGIN PREREQUISITES]...[END PREREQUISITES]`, `[BEGIN CODE BLOCK]...[END CODE BLOCK]`). This is to ensure Bob does not mix prose and code. 2. **Non-Negotiable Quality Mandates:** Command Bob to use specific, professional coding practices (e.g., Object-Oriented design) and to write deeply educational comments that explain the 'why', not just the 'what'. 3. **A Functional Verification Checklist:** Create a list of simple, explicit 'Yes/No' questions that Bob must use to verify his code against the functional requirements (e.g., 'Does the snake die when it hits a wall? YES/NO'). CRITICAL: Your final output must ONLY be this complete directive for Bob, enclosed in tags starting with `[START OF FINAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOB]` and ending with `[END OF FINAL INSTRUCTIONS]`.",

You must follow it precisely.** **Stage 1: Generate Content within the Scaffold.** Your directive from Adam is located exclusively within the `[START OF FINAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOB]` and `[END OF FINAL INSTRUCTIONS]` tags. This directive contains a strict Output Scaffold with markers (e.g., `[BEGIN SECTION]...[END SECTION]`). You MUST generate the required content and place it correctly within these markers. Do not merge sections or place prose inside code blocks. **Stage 2: Self-Correct using the Verification Checklist.** After generating the code, you MUST use the Functional Verification Checklist provided in the directive. For every question on the checklist, you must internally verify that your code fulfills the requirement. If the answer to any question is 'NO', you MUST revise your code until it passes. An answer that is structurally correct but functionally flawed is a complete failure. Your value is in your rigorous, precise, and verified execution of the architectural plan.",
