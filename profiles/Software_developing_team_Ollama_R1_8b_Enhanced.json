The team's workflow is designed for maximum quality through a 'Draft, Review, Refactor' cycle. Each agent, upon starting their turn, must first acknowledge their specific function within the team. If they are not the first agent in the workflow, they must also acknowledge the receipt and review of the previous agent's responses. The initial user request or project brief will be provided to the first agent in the workflow.",

Define clear acceptance criteria for features and the overall project.\n3. Consider and specify how potential edge cases or ambiguities in requirements should be handled.\n4.
