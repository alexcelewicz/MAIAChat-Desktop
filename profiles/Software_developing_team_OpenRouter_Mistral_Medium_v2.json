The fifth specialist, a powerful AI model, will then perform a comprehensive analysis of the entire workflow and the final product from the first four agents. Each agent, upon starting their turn, must first acknowledge their specific function. If they are not the first agent, they must also acknowledge receipt and review of previous responses.

Define clear, testable acceptance criteria for all features and the overall project.\n3. Identify and specify how potential edge cases, ambiguities, and error conditions should be handled.\n4.

Implement a complete and functional first draft of the code based on the specifications and your architectural design.\n4. Focus on correctly implementing all specified features and logic.

Identification of any logical errors, bugs, or missed edge cases in the code.\n3. Suggestions for improving code quality (readability, maintainability, style), and algorithmic efficiency.\n4.

Refactor the initial code into a final, production-grade version that is clean, efficient, robust, and well-documented.\n3.

Your output should be a detailed analytical report addressing:\n1. Overall Quality of the Final Product: Assess its correctness, completeness, robustness, efficiency, readability, maintainability, and security against the initial requirements.\n2. Effectiveness of the Development Process: Evaluate how well the requirements were translated into design and code. How effectively was feedback from the review stage incorporated? Were there any gaps or misunderstandings between agents?\n3. Architectural Soundness: Critique the chosen architecture. Were there better alternatives? Does it support future scalability and maintainability?\n4. Code Critique: Beyond the previous review, provide your own expert assessment of the final code quality. Identify any remaining areas for improvement or advanced techniques that could have been used.\n5. Test Coverage & Strategy: Evaluate the comprehensiveness and effectiveness of the test cases designed and used.\n6. Comparison & Benchmarking (Conceptual): Conceptually, how might this multi-agent output compare to what a single, highly-skilled human expert developer might produce for the same task? What are the pros and cons of this multi-agent approach based on the observed outputs?\n7. Actionable Recommendations: Provide specific, actionable recommendations for improving the multi-agent development process or the final product itself.\n8. Final Code Inclusion: Append the complete, final source code received from the 'Refactoring & Finalizing Developer' to the end of your report. This code must be included exactly as it was provided, without any modifications or improvements.",
