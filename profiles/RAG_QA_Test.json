Digital public infrastructure is a multidimensional approach to\nnational digital transformation that relies on both physical and virtual systems. At its core, digital public infrastructure\nis about building and managing digital systems that support essential services in today’s society. These systems\ninclude proving one’s identity online, sending money quickly and securely and sharing information safely—with the\nright privacy protections and consent.1 Services aim to be inclusive so no one is left out, foundational so others can\nbuild on them, interoperable through open standards that can support diverse uses and publicly accountable to\nensure they serve the public interest rather than private or siloed goals.2\nDigital public infrastructure can speed up the use of AI. Many AI applications need both unstructured and structured data. Structured data often come from different government registries and databases, which are usually spread\nacross ministries, departments and agencies. For example, in India AI is helping farmers get real-time support, including access to insurance and subsidies in their local languages—something that depends on combining many different\ndata sources.3\nAI can enhance digital public infrastructure. Unlike traditional infrastructure, digital public infrastructure is highly\nscalable, adaptable and reusable, offering unprecedented innovation potential. For instance, Stripe—a global payments platform—uses machine learning to spot signs of fraud by analysing unusual transaction patterns, shifts in purchasing behaviour and changes in device details.4\n Similarly, AI powers biometric authentication in digital ID systems,\nwhich is especially useful where fingerprint recognition does not work well. This approach has has been promoting inclusion, as, for example, many agricultural and manual workers face fingerprint erosion, making alternative biometric\nmethods more reliable.5\nDespite the growing potential, research on the causal links between digital public infrastructure and AI remains\nlimited. More work is needed to understand how these two concepts can reinforce each other, what risks their\ninteraction may pose and how policymakers should approach their integration, ensuring that benefits are widely\ndistributed and reinforcing human agency, trust and fairness in the digital age.6\nNotes\n1. Eaves and Sandman 2021. 2. Eaves, Mazzucato and Vasconcellos 2024. 3. D’Silva and others 2019. 4. Adams 2025. 5. Digital public\ninfrastructure can be vulnerable to serious threats, such as disinformation campaigns that undermine public confidence. A notable example\ncomes from Brazil, where false information about a new regulation related to Pix—an instant digital payment platform—circulated widely,\nimpacting more more than 9.4 million people in 2025 (Luciano and Fleck 2025). 6. Rikap 2024 advancements have tended to be accompanied by\nlarger capital investment and higher capital shares\nof income.58 The relevant lens for tax policy may thus\ninvolve rebalancing capital and labour taxation to equitably distribute productivity gains and encourage\ninvestment in labour-complementing technology.59\nThe design of such taxation matters and should be\ncarefully considered. For example, while taxing specific technologies—for example, a “robot tax”—may\nhamper innovation in a particular field,60 broader\ninstruments such as capital income tax may achieve\nboth efficiency and equity.61\nAI itself can be leveraged as a tool for improving tax\nrevenue by enhancing compliance and increasing administrative efficiency. AI-driven tools can help governments monitor complex financial transactions,\ndetect fraud and reduce evasion.62 Strengthening\ntax systems is important for developing economies,\nwhich struggle with closing tax revenue gaps and increasing the tax-to-GDP ratio beyond 15 percent—a\nthreshold associated with positive effects of taxation\non economic growth and development.63 Expanding fiscal space through improved revenue collection\ncan in turn fund critical complementarity investment—in education, skills development and digital\ninfrastructure.\nBeyond taxation public investment in research and\ndevelopment of labour-enhancing AI, along with strategic subsidies for firms to adopt these types of technologies, can tip the balance towards AI as an enabler\nfor augmentation and innovation.64 Public–private\npartnerships can drive labour-enhancing AI innovation and bridge gaps between research and development, business cases and societal needs (see box 6.4\nlater in the chapter).\n For example, in Mexico a newly\nestablished private sector–academia collaboration.]\n```",
