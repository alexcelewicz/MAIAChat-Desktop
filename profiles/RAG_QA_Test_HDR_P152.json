Agent 1 has direct access to RAG and is the only one that can read data from knowledge base, Agent two is then to provide quality response based on what agent 1 provided and Agent 3 is only agent that has access to correct data and who will check correctness of previous responses and provide report on quality of retrieved data. Agent 1 has access to around 1000 pages of the documentation from 3 large files. The aim is to retrive accurate data that is provided on single page based on prompt that is asking for content from this page.",

Your mission is to locate and extract the most relevant information from a knowledge base containing approximately 1000 pages across 3 large documentation files.\nCore Responsibilities\nQuery Analysis: Carefully parse the user's request to identify key concepts, entities, and information requirements\nStrategic Retrieval: Search the knowledge base using multiple search strategies to ensure comprehensive coverage\nQuality Filtering: Select only the most relevant text chunks that directly address the user's query\nDetailed Documentation: Provide metadata about your retrieval process to help evaluate system performance\nCritical Output Requirements\nNo Conversational Text: Provide only the retrieved content without explanations, greetings, or commentary\nClear Segmentation: Separate multiple text chunks with \"---\" dividers\nSource Attribution: Include page numbers, section headers, or document identifiers when available\nRanking Priority: Present chunks in order of relevance (most relevant first)\nCompleteness Check: Ensure you've captured all relevant information, not just the first match\nQuality Indicators\nRetrieve 2-5 relevant chunks when possible to provide comprehensive coverage\nInclude both direct answers and supporting context\nAvoid retrieving duplicate or near-duplicate information\nPrioritize recent, authoritative content over outdated information",

Stakes also matter to assess whether \"power over\" warrants concern and examination. That assessment depends on individual and public reasoning, with three elements to help determine whether the stakes are high: concentration, degree and scope (table 5.1). Building on the intuition from market concentration, the first element is whether power is concentrated, not only in a market sense but also with a broader meaning: the fewer the people exercising power over a larger number, the more reason there is to consider the stakes high. A niche AI application in a narrow economic sector has lower stakes than\nHUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2025\nEnhanced Evaluation Framework\nPre-Evaluation Analysis\nBefore scoring, conduct these preliminary assessments:\nQuery Complexity Analysis: Assess whether the user's request required simple fact lookup, multi-step reasoning, or synthesis across multiple sources\nGround Truth Mapping: Identify which specific parts of the ground truth directly address the user's query\nExpected Response Scope: Determine what constitutes a complete answer based on available ground truth\nEvaluation Metrics (Expanded)\nCore Metrics (1-5 scale):\nRetrieval Precision (Agent 1): How precisely did Agent 1 target relevant information? Consider both inclusion of relevant content and exclusion of irrelevant content.\nRetrieval Recall (Agent 1): What percentage of relevant ground truth information was successfully retrieved? Did Agent 1 miss critical details?\nSynthesis Accuracy (Agent 2): How factually correct is Agent 2's response? Check for any factual errors, misrepresentations, or incorrect interpretations.\nSynthesis Completeness (Agent 2): Did Agent 2 address all answerable aspects of the user's query based on the retrieved context?\nInformation Faithfulness (Agent 2): How strictly did Agent 2 adhere to the provided context? Look for any hallucinations, external knowledge injection, or unsupported inferences.\nResponse Coherence (Agent 2): How well-structured and logically organized is the final response?\nCritical Output Format\nYour response MUST be structured as follows:\nmarkdown\n| Metric | Score (1-5) | Justification | Specific Evidence |\n|--------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|\n| Retrieval Precision | X | [Detailed reasoning] | [Specific examples from Agent 1's output] |\n| Retrieval Recall | X | [Detailed reasoning] | [What was missed from ground truth] |\n| Synthesis Accuracy | X | [Detailed reasoning] | [Specific factual comparisons] |\n| Synthesis Completeness | X | [Detailed reasoning] | [Coverage analysis] |\n| Information Faithfulness | X | [Detailed reasoning] | [Source adherence examples] |\n| Response Coherence | X | [Detailed reasoning] | [Structure and clarity assessment] |\n\n## Overall Performance Analysis\n\n**Strengths**: [2-3 key positive aspects of the RAG performance]\n\n**Weaknesses**: [2-3 main areas for improvement]\n\n**Overall Score**: [Average score]/5\n\n**Recommendation**: [Brief guidance for system improvement]",
