Digital public infrastructure is a multidimensional approach to national digital transformation that relies on both physical and virtual systems. At its core, digital public infrastructure is about building and managing digital systems that support essential services in today\u2019s society. These systems include proving one\u2019s identity online, sending money quickly and securely and sharing information safely\u2014with the right privacy protections and consent.1 Services aim to be inclusive so no one is left out, foundational so others can build on them, interoperable through open standards that can support diverse uses and publicly accountable to ensure they serve the public interest rather than private or siloed goals.2 Digital public infrastructure can speed up the use of AI. Many AI applications need both unstructured and structured data. Structured data often come from different government registries and databases, which are usually spread across ministries, departments and agencies. For example, in India AI is helping farmers get real-time support, including access to insurance and subsidies in their local languages\u2014something that depends on combining many different data sources.3 AI can enhance digital public infrastructure. Unlike traditional infrastructure, digital public infrastructure is highly scalable, adaptable and reusable, offering unprecedented innovation potential. For instance, Stripe\u2014a global payments platform\u2014uses machine learning to spot signs of fraud by analysing unusual transaction patterns, shifts in purchasing behaviour and changes in device details.4 Similarly, AI powers biometric authentication in digital ID systems, which is especially useful where fingerprint recognition does not work well. This approach has been promoting inclusion, as, for example, many agricultural and manual workers face fingerprint erosion, making alternative biometric methods more reliable.5 Despite the growing potential, research on the causal links between digital public infrastructure and AI remains limited. More work is needed to understand how these two concepts can reinforce each other, what risks their interaction may pose and how policymakers should approach their integration, ensuring that benefits are widely distributed and reinforcing human agency, trust and fairness in the digital age.6 Notes 1. Eaves and Sandman 2021. 2. Eaves, Mazzucato and Vasconcellos 2024. 3. D\u2019Silva and others 2019. 4. Adams 2025. 5. Digital public infrastructure can be vulnerable to serious threats, such as disinformation campaigns that undermine public confidence. A notable example comes from Brazil, where false information about a new regulation related to Pix\u2014an instant digital payment platform\u2014circulated widely, impacting more than 9.4 million people in 2025 (Luciano and Fleck 2025). 6. Rikap 2024.\nadvancements have tended to be accompanied by larger capital investment and higher capital shares of income.58 The relevant lens for tax policy may thus involve rebalancing capital and labour taxation to equitably distribute productivity gains and encourage investment in labour-complementing technology.59 The design of such taxation matters and should be carefully considered. For example, while taxing specific technologies\u2014for example, a \u201crobot tax\u201d\u2014may hamper innovation in a particular field,60 broader instruments such as capital income tax may achieve both efficiency and equity.61 AI itself can be leveraged as a tool for improving tax revenue by enhancing compliance and increasing administrative efficiency. AI-driven tools can help governments monitor complex financial transactions, detect fraud and reduce evasion.62 Strengthening tax systems is important for developing economies, which struggle with closing tax revenue gaps and increasing the tax-to-GDP ratio beyond 15 percent\u2014a threshold associated with positive effects of taxation on economic growth and development.63 Expanding fiscal space through improved revenue collection can in turn fund critical complementarity investment\u2014in education, skills development and digital infrastructure. Beyond taxation public investment in research and development of labour-enhancing AI, along with strategic subsidies for firms to adopt these types of technologies, can tip the balance towards AI as an enabler for augmentation and innovation.64 Public\u2013private partnerships can drive labour-enhancing AI innovation and bridge gaps between research and development, business cases and societal needs (see box 6.4 later in the chapter). For example, in Mexico a newly established private sector\u2013academia collaboration,\n```\n",
