# MCP Double-Pass Mode Configuration Guide

## Overview

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) Double-Pass Mode toggle allows you to choose between two processing modes for MCP commands:

- **Single-Pass Mode** (faster, less reliable)
- **Double-Pass Mode** (slower, more reliable) ‚≠ê **Recommended**

## Accessing the Setting

### Windows
1. Run the application: `python start_app.py`
2. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **MCP Configuration** (or use the toolbar button)
3. In the **General MCP Settings** section at the top, you'll see "Enable Double-Pass Mode"
4. Check/uncheck the box to toggle between modes
5. Changes are saved immediately

### Linux  
1. Run the application: `python start_app.py`
2. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **MCP Configuration** (or use the toolbar button)
3. In the **General MCP Settings** section at the top, you'll see "Enable Double-Pass Mode"
4. Check/uncheck the box to toggle between modes
5. Changes are saved immediately

## What Each Mode Does

### Single-Pass Mode (`MCP_SINGLE_PASS_MODE: true`)
- **Speed**: ‚ö° Fast
- **Reliability**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Lower accuracy (~10% success rate)
- **How it works**: Processes MCP commands in one pass, agents sometimes hallucinate content instead of using actual MCP results
- **Best for**: Quick testing or when speed is more important than accuracy

### Double-Pass Mode (`MCP_SINGLE_PASS_MODE: false`) ‚≠ê **Recommended**
- **Speed**: üêå Slower
- **Reliability**: ‚úÖ High accuracy (~90%+ success rate)
- **How it works**: Processes MCP commands in two passes, dramatically improving accuracy by ensuring agents use real MCP data
- **Best for**: Production use, important file operations, reliable multi-agent collaboration

## Configuration File

The setting is stored in `config.json`:

```json
{
  "MCP_SINGLE_PASS_MODE": false
}
```

- `false` = Double-Pass Mode enabled (recommended)
- `true` = Single-Pass Mode enabled (faster but less reliable)

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

‚úÖ **Windows**: Fully supported  
‚úÖ **Linux**: Fully supported  
‚úÖ **macOS**: Should work (same PyQt6 codebase)

## Technical Details

### The Problem
In single-pass mode, agents would often generate fake content after MCP commands like `[MCP:Local Files:read_file:path]` instead of waiting for and using the actual file content returned by the MCP system.

### The Solution
Double-pass mode ensures that:
1. **First pass**: MCP commands are identified and executed
2. **Second pass**: Agent responses are processed with actual MCP results
3. **Result**: Agents use real data instead of hallucinated content

### Performance Impact
- **Single-pass**: ~2-5 seconds per agent response
- **Double-pass**: ~4-10 seconds per agent response
- **Trade-off**: 2x processing time for 9x improvement in reliability

## Testing Your Configuration

You can verify your setting is working by:

1. **Check the UI**: The checkbox should reflect your current setting
2. **Check config.json**: Look for `"MCP_SINGLE_PASS_MODE": false` (double-pass) or `true` (single-pass)
3. **Test MCP commands**: Try having an agent read a file - in double-pass mode, it should show the actual file content

## Troubleshooting

### Setting Not Saving
- Make sure you have write permissions to the application directory
- Check that `config.json` exists and is writable
- Look for error messages in the application logs

### UI Not Updating
- Restart the application after changing the setting
- Check the tooltip shows the correct description
- Verify PyQt6 is properly installed

### Performance Issues
- If double-pass mode is too slow, you can temporarily use single-pass for testing
- Consider the trade-off: reliability vs. speed
- For production/important work, always use double-pass mode

## Support

This feature was implemented to solve critical MCP reliability issues discovered during multi-agent file collaboration testing. The double-pass mode represents the recommended approach for reliable MCP operations.
